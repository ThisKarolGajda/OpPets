  # Every skill has max level, after which pet becomes unnecessary, thanks to prestige system
  # we were able to make a never-ending farming level pet. After every pet maxed level, owner
  # can choose if they want to exchange pet into new prestige. If they do they lost every
  # statistic on pet, but they get ability to get skills rewards again, and get new prestige
  # levels. ☆
